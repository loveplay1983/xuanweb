        <p>A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways. Often
            called a "web site" or a "site."
            A website is a collection of linked web pages (plus their associated resources) that share a unique domain
            name. Each web page of a given website provides explicit links—most of the time in the form of clickable
            portions of text—that allow the user to move from one page of the website to another.
